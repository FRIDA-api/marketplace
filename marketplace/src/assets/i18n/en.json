A standardized, openly documented interface is the key to efficient connectivity and entry into the platform economy. End users (natural and legal persons) gain access to their data and can use it in a targeted manner with the help of new dedicated services and platforms. Insurers benefit from controlled, standardized data exchange and can also enter the role of a third-party provider, making customer portals or advisory processes, for example, more attractive for customers and intermediaries.",
